# smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics
Project during my engineering course as part of the computer science course on object-oriented programming. The aim of the project was to apply the concepts and tools of object-oriented programming (classes, algorithms, arrays, lists, files, graphical interfaces) to a concrete and original problem, resulting in the production of a small piece of software. In this project, I simulated free-surface flows using particle methods. These methods are widely used in physics and video games to simulate liquids. Particle methods allow a flow to be represented by a multitude of moving particles. I have dealt with the 2D case where the particles move in one plane (that of the screen).
