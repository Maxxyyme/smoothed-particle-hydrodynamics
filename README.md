# smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics
The aim of the project was to apply the concepts and tools of object-oriented programming (classes, algorithms, arrays, files, graphical interfaces) to a concrete and original problem, resulting in the simulation of free-surface flows using particle methods. I have dealt with the 2D case where the particles move in one plane (that of the screen).
